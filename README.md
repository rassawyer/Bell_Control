# Bell Control

## Background
About a month ago, I was asked by a client to install an alarm bell that could notify an employee in their warehouse/shop area, whenever the door to their showroom was opened. This is a commercial setting nad the ambient noise level is fairly high, so I designed and installed a circuit using an 85dB, 120VAC alarm bell from Amazon. The bell is controlled by a relay, driven by a 12VDC power supply, and triggered by a Reed switch on the door. All in all, a fairly straigh-forward circuit. Unfortunately, no sooner was it placed into service than the client requested a modification. As it happens, the door to the showroom spends quite a bit of time open, and the alarm bell rings the whole time that it is open. The other occupants of the building were displeased. The client requested that I configure it so that the bell would ring twice, for 3 seconds each time. Thus I began writing a project to use and ESP8266 to take an input from a 12VDC source, and trigger a relay. However, the thought in the back of my mind the whole time was "Does this client realize how long 3 seconds of 85dB bell ringing is?". I fear the answer is that he does not, and so I embarked on a much more challenging adventure: How to write a web server, that could serve multiple pages, take input from the user, and update variables, so that the client could easily configure On Time/Off Time/Cycle counts for himself.
